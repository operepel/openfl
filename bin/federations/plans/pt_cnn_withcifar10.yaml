# Compose an FL plan in JSON/YAML.
# The plan is consumed by bin/run_simulation_from_flplan.py,
# bin/run_aggregator_from_flplan, bin/run_collaborator_from_flplan, and
# bin/create_initial_weights_file_from_plan.py

# Note the use of yaml anchors and aliases in order to enforce dependencies
# across portions of the config:
# The anochor '&' assigns a name to a piece of the config
# The alias '*' references an achor 

# values for first level keys: model, aggregator, and collaborator
# pass in the generic kwargs for those constructors
# (ex. collaborator id will be collaborator specific)

# values for first level keys: model and data pass in the generic
# kwargs for get_model and get_data functions

# values for the first level key: hostnames is used in the creation of the public
# key infrastructure

# The model version is used to validate model updates
# Aggregator, collaborator, and fed ids (as well as model version) are currently
# used to validate message headers. Collaborator ids are also
# used for identifying the data folder of each collaborator
# (using the local_data_config yaml file)
